JS app
This Java script app was created to compelete the requirments of my schooling at CareerFoundry.
The app started with learning and coding vanilla javascript.
In this vanilla JS we learned how to pull an api to create our pokedex that is now shown.
In vanilla JS we learned how to create a modal that displays the selected pokemon's stats that we chose to list. by hitting a modal button that we created.
After learning how to build a modal, we then intergrated Bootstrap to our JS app added and edited
- a nav bar
- a search function within the nav bar
- a new modal insert
- a modal pop up that displays stats and an image of the selected pokemon

Within the most updated version of this JS app we should have Sr-only available throughout to make our app accessible.
